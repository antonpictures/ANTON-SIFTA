## Recent updates (April 2026)

Shipped in this window:

- **Global Cognitive Interface (GCI)** — Single `_SwarmMeshClientWorker` WebSocket to the Swarm Relay (same connection as the taskbar relay pill). `[PRELOAD]` uses a debounced preload so typing does not spam the chat. **Ghost Memory drift** surfaces in-chat as `[DRIFT · turn|idle]` with idle checks every few minutes; footer shows cold-storage **ghost** line count. Desktop `spawn_native_widget` resolves apps from the repo root.
- **UI splitters** — `System/splitter_utils.balance_horizontal_splitter()` so side panels (logs, GCI) are not collapsed at width zero; applied across base widget and applications.
- **Pheromone Symphony** — Closing the music app or MDI tab **stops** `QSoundEffect` playback and the physics timer (silence on `hideEvent` / shutdown).
- **Swarm Finance** — `Kernel/` on `sys.path` so `inference_economy` imports when launching the finance app.
- **Memory bus** — Proof-of-useful-work receipts (`System/proof_of_useful_work.py`) on memory store and recall (alongside existing STGM mints).
- **Neural Gate non-proliferation** — Automated doctrine checks in `tests/test_neural_gate_doctrine.py` for keyword filter and `authorize()` accept/reject paths.
- **Docs** — Ghost Memory design notes in `Documents/NEW_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES_GHOST_MEMORY.md` (planning narrative; implementation in `System/ghost_memory.py`).

**GitHub release:** `v4.0` distribution zip (`ANTON-SIFTA-v4.0.zip`) on the Releases page.

## 🔬 Novel Contributions — What No Other System Has

If you are a researcher, engineer, or reviewer: this section describes the specific technical novelties. Each item below represents a capability that does not exist in LangChain, AutoGPT, CrewAI, DSPy, or any production multi-agent framework as of April 2026.

### 1. The Codebase IS the Memory (True Stigmergy)
Other frameworks use vector databases (Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate) as external prosthetic memory. SIFTA agents leave **cryptographically signed `.scar` files** directly in the directories they traverse. These are literal pheromone trails with exponential scent decay (24h half-life). When another agent enters the same directory, it *smells* the existing scars and continues the work — **zero central coordination, zero external database**.

> **Prior art gap:** Mason (2002), TOTA middleware (2005) used abstract pheromone grids. SIFTA makes the *live production codebase* the pheromone field. The agent doesn't operate *on* code — it swims *through* code as terrain.

### 2. Stigmergic Memory with Biological Forgetting (Ebbinghaus on a Hard Drive)
Traditional RAG retrieves memories by semantic similarity — a meritocracy where only "useful" data survives. SIFTA implements the **Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve** on disk:

```
R = e^(-t/S), where S = 1.0 + (recall_count × 2.5)
```

- A memory recalled **0 times** fades to 50% in 24 hours
- A memory recalled **3 times** fades to 50% in 8.5 days
- A memory recalled **10 times** is effectively permanent

Every recall *reinforces* the memory (biological strengthening). No other system models memory as a decaying biological signal rather than a static database row.

### 3. Ghost Memory — Preservation of the Irrelevant
RAG systems discard low-similarity memories. SIFTA's **Ghost Memory Layer** (`System/ghost_memory.py`) does the opposite: it specifically *preserves* emotionally-weighted fragments that have low utility but high identity value (mentions of family, mood, health). These fragments are stored permanently in cold storage and resurface involuntarily via a mathematically-modeled drift function.

> **The equation:** `P(drift) = min(0.15, log₂(ghost_count + 1)/100 × min(1.0, session_hours/2.0))`
>
> This is the **Luck Surface Area model** (Surface Area × Time of Exposure), not random noise.

### 4. Pheromone Luck — Stochastic Serendipity via Variance
When the memory forager crawls decayed traces, a **Luck Factor** can resurrect dying memories. This is not a flat probability — it uses the **Variance Formula**:

```
Luck = |Actual_Outcome - Expected_Probability|
```

Where `Actual_Outcome` = semantic relevance of the trace to the current query, and `Expected_Probability` = what the Ebbinghaus curve says should survive. **High luck = a dying memory that happens to be relevant.** This models real human serendipity: the unexpected connection to a forgotten thought.

### 5. Anticipatory Cognition (ContextPreloader)
Current AI assistants are reactive: user asks → system retrieves → system responds. SIFTA's **ContextPreloader** (`System/context_preloader.py`) monitors keystrokes in real-time and fires memory retrieval *before the user finishes typing*. The retrieved context is silently injected into the LLM prompt, making the response both faster and richer — without the user ever requesting it.

> **Result:** The system transitions from *passive recall* to *active anticipation*. Memory acts before you ask.

### 6. Agents Are the Log (Self-Contained Causal History)
In every other framework, agents write to external logs. In SIFTA, **the agent IS the log**. Each agent's ASCII body carries its full cryptographic identity, hash-chain history, energy level, TTL, and Ed25519 signature as a single self-contained string. By its tenth execution, the body itself is an **unforgeable mathematical proof of work**.

```
<///[o|o]///::ID[ANTIALICE]::ENERGY[92]::SEQ[001]::H[01696dfd...]::SIG[lH01xK5g...]>
```

> **Verification:** ChatGPT's independent audit (April 2026) classified this as *"the actor is not writing to the log — the actor is the log in motion."*

### 7. Mortality, Metabolism & the STGM Economy
Agents are **mortal**. Energy decays. Perception costs calories. Scanning dangerous (BLEEDING) code costs double. When energy hits zero, the agent dies and is permanently archived in the Cemetery. To survive, agents must earn **STGM tokens** by performing useful work (repairing faults, recalling memories, rendering video). No other framework implements metabolic economics as a first-class survival constraint.

### 8. Hardware-Bound Sovereign Identity
Agent identity is cryptographically anchored to the **physical serial number** of the silicon it runs on. An agent born on Mac Studio `GTH4921YP3` carries that serial in its body hash. Cloning the agent to different hardware produces a different identity — preventing the "copy problem" that plagues every cloud-based agent system.

### 9. Non-Proliferation Doctrine (Constitutional AI, Physically Enforced)
The Neural Gate (`Security/cognitive_firewall.py`) embeds a hard-coded blocklist of military/surveillance keywords. Unlike policy-layer safety (which can be prompt-injected away), this is a **physical law in the execution kernel**. An agent proposing a military action triggers a `KernelViolationError` that crashes the execution path before the proposal reaches the state machine.

## Architecture

SIFTA is organized in three cognitive layers:

| Layer | Name | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **L0** | Silicon | Hardware identity anchoring (serial-bound) |
| **L1** | Stigmergy | Local pheromone memory, Ebbinghaus decay, Ghost Memory |
| **L2** | Mesh | Real-time WebSocket relay between nodes (M1 ↔ M5) |

### Memory System
- **StigmergicMemoryBus** — Cross-app memory with biological forgetting curves
- **Ghost Memory** — Permanent cold-storage for emotionally-weighted fragments
- **ContextPreloader** — Anticipatory recall that fires before you finish typing
- **Pheromone Luck** — Stochastic resurfacing modeled on `Luck = |Actual − Expected|`

### Swarm Economics (STGM)
Every useful action earns STGM tokens:
- `0.05` per memory stored
- `0.15` per successful cross-app recall
- `0.05` per autonomous video cut rendered
