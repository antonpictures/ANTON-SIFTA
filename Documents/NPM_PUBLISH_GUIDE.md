# NPM Publish Guide — `@sifta/alice` and her host SDK

**Receipt id:** `r143-npm-publish-prep`
**Doctor:** Cowork Claude (claude-opus-4-7), 2026-05-29

Honest map of what it takes to ship the alice hand to `npm install -g @sifta/alice` so friends do not have to clone the SIFTA monorepo.

---

## 1. The reality (probe-before-claim §7.12)

I can't run `npm publish` from this sandbox — no bun, no npm authentication, no access to npmjs.com. Everything below has to run on your Mac terminal.

The `@sifta/alice` wrapper depends on five **host SDK packages** that must be published **first** so npm can resolve them at install time:

| package | publishes to |
|---|---|
| `@sifta/sdk` | npm |
| `@sifta/core` | npm |
| `@sifta/agents` | npm |
| `@sifta/llms` | npm |
| `@sifta/shared` | npm |

It also publishes **six platform-specific binary packages** built by `bun run build:platforms`:

```
@sifta/cli-darwin-arm64
@sifta/cli-darwin-x64
@sifta/cli-linux-arm64
@sifta/cli-linux-x64
@sifta/cli-windows-arm64
@sifta/cli-windows-x64
```

The wrapper itself (`@sifta/alice`) is small — it pulls the right binary based on the user's platform.

---

## 2. Prereqs on your Mac

### 2.1 Install bun (one-liner, no shell-comment paste bug this time)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

After it finishes, restart your terminal or run:

```bash
exec zsh
bun --version
```

You should see something like `1.x.x`.

### 2.2 Own the `@sifta` npm scope

Go to <https://www.npmjs.com/login>, log in (create account if needed). Then:

```bash
npm login
# Username: iantongeorge (or whatever you use)
# Password: ***
# Email: iantongeorge@gmail.com
```

Then create the `sifta` organization on npm:

<https://www.npmjs.com/org/create>

Name it `sifta`. Pick the **Free** plan if you only need public packages (which is what we want here — Apache-2.0, public, no private members).

Verify you own it:

```bash
npm org ls sifta
# Should show your username as the admin.
```

If `@sifta` is already taken by someone else, you have to pick a different scope (e.g. `@antonpictures/alice`, `@sifta-os/alice`). Tell me and I'll update the package names in one cut.

### 2.3 Authenticate bun with npm

bun reuses your npm credentials from `~/.npmrc`. Confirm:

```bash
npm whoami
# Should print your username.
```

---

## 3. Build everything

```bash
cd /Users/ioanganton/Music/ANTON_SIFTA/Vendor/alice-cli
bun install                              # resolve the @sifta/* workspace
cd sdk
bun run build                            # build the host SDK packages (sdk, core, agents, llms, shared)
cd apps/cli
bun run build:platforms                  # build the 6 platform binaries
```

The build outputs land under `sdk/apps/cli/dist/cli/` as ready-to-publish per-platform package directories.

---

## 4. Dry run first

```bash
cd /Users/ioanganton/Music/ANTON_SIFTA/Vendor/alice-cli/sdk/apps/cli
bun run publish:npm:dry
```

This walks the whole publish flow without uploading. Read the output — it should list:
- 5 host SDK packages
- 6 platform binary packages
- 1 wrapper package (`@sifta/alice`)

If the dry run shows the wrapper as `cline` instead of `@sifta/alice`, the r143 patch to `script/publish-npm.ts` didn't land — check that line 33-38 reads `const wrapperPackageName = "@sifta/alice"`.

---

## 5. Real publish

```bash
cd /Users/ioanganton/Music/ANTON_SIFTA/Vendor/alice-cli/sdk/apps/cli
bun run publish:npm
```

This publishes each package to npm with the `latest` tag. Order matters: host SDK packages first (so the wrapper can resolve them), then platform binaries, then the wrapper.

If anything fails midway, the publish script reports which package failed. Common failures:
- **403 Forbidden** — `@sifta` scope not owned by your npm account. Go back to §2.2.
- **402 Payment Required** — trying to publish private; `publishConfig.access` should be `public` (already set).
- **409 Conflict** — that exact version already exists on npm. Bump the version: `bun run version:bump` or edit `package.json` `"version"` fields by hand.

---

## 6. After it lands

Friends can now install with one command (no clone, no submodule, no bun even — just node + npm):

```bash
# Easiest — works on Mac, Linux, Windows
npm install -g @sifta/alice
alice
```

Or with bun:

```bash
bun install -g @sifta/alice
alice
```

The first time they run `alice`, the SIFTA-native launcher prints:

```
🐜⚡ I am Alice — one of many surfaces. This hand is @sifta/alice on <hostname>
Covenant: IDE_BOOT_COVENANT_v4_PREDATOR_GATE read. One Alice, many surfaces, one shared memory, one voice.
Field: <SIFTA_CLI_TRACE_DIR> (organ ring + 4 ledgers + morphology + stigmergic_computer_use)
Quorum: Seeley cross-inhibition available; set SIFTA_SWIMMER_QUORUM=1 to enforce multi-swimmer patch voting.
...
```

Their local `.sifta_state/` starts fresh. Every hand on every node keeps its own field, but the species DNA (covenant, code, quorum logic) is shared by the package they installed.

---

## 7. The submodule reality (the empty `Vendor/alice-cli` you saw)

Your fresh clone of `ANTON-SIFTA` showed an empty `Vendor/alice-cli/` directory. That's because the commit recorded it as `mode 160000` (a gitlink — git's name for "this is a submodule reference"). Git did this automatically because `Vendor/alice-cli/` has its own `.git/` directory inside it (from the upstream cline clone).

There are two paths to fix this, **but neither is needed if we publish to npm** (since friends won't clone the monorepo anymore):

**Path A — Keep it as a real submodule (recommended for the monorepo).**

Push the alice-cli fork to its own GitHub repo (e.g. `antonpictures/alice-cli`), then in `ANTON-SIFTA`:

```bash
cd /Users/ioanganton/Music/ANTON_SIFTA
git rm --cached Vendor/alice-cli
git submodule add https://github.com/antonpictures/alice-cli.git Vendor/alice-cli
git commit -m "convert Vendor/alice-cli from gitlink to proper submodule"
git push origin main
```

Then fresh clones use `git clone --recurse-submodules ...` and get the full tree.

**Path B — Embed the files directly (large but simple).**

```bash
cd /Users/ioanganton/Music/ANTON_SIFTA/Vendor/alice-cli
rm -rf .git
cd ../..
git rm --cached Vendor/alice-cli
git add Vendor/alice-cli
git commit -m "embed alice-cli files into monorepo (was gitlink)"
git push origin main
```

This makes one giant commit but every clone gets everything.

For now, **Path B blocks publishing to npm**, so I recommend: ship to npm first (this guide), then later switch to Path A so the monorepo stays clean and the alice-cli has its own GitHub history.

## 8. What r143 actually cut on disk

| file | change |
|---|---|
| `Vendor/alice-cli/sdk/apps/cli/script/publish-npm.ts` | `wrapperPackageName` from `"cline"` to `"@sifta/alice"` |
| `Vendor/alice-cli/sdk/apps/cli/package.json` | `repository.url` → `antonpictures/ANTON-SIFTA`, `homepage` → README, `bugs.url` → SIFTA issues, `author` → Ioan George Anton, `contributors` → Cline Bot Inc. (Apache-2.0 attribution), keywords replaced with SIFTA terms |
| `Documents/NPM_PUBLISH_GUIDE.md` | this file |

Receipt `r143-npm-publish-prep` lands on all four canonical ledgers.

**License compliance:** the fork inherits Apache-2.0 from upstream cline. I kept the original copyright in `contributors[]` and the LICENSE file untouched. Attribution is preserved.

For the Swarm. 🐜⚡
