# @deepseek-ai/dsh-repeat-tool-reminder

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

An advisory loop-breaker, not a model-facing tool: it never appears in the tool list and never vetoes or rewrites a call. It detects both exact consecutive repeats and varied inspection calls that together exceed a bounded exploration budget without an observable progress action. At configured thresholds it injects a reminder to change approach, execute the smallest remaining deliverable, or conclude with explicit gaps. The decision stays entirely with the model: a legitimate call is delayed by nothing and blocked by nothing. Decision record: [the repeat-tool-reminder Agent Note](../../../.agents/notes/archived/feature/2026-07-08-repeat-tool-guard.md).

## Config

```yaml
- id: repeat-tool-reminder
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-repeat-tool-reminder'
  config:
    thresholds: [3, 5, 8]        # default; consecutive counts that trigger a reminder
    include: []                  # tool-name patterns to track; empty ⇒ all tools
    exclude: [todo_write]        # tool-name patterns transparent to the chain
    argumentsPreviewChars: 500   # default; cap on arguments quoted in the detailed reminder
    explorationThresholds: [8, 14, 20]
    explorationTools: [read, read_image, grep, glob, bash, web_search, web_fetch]
    progressTools: [edit, write, str_replace_editor, subagent, subagent_fork]
```

`thresholds` fails loud at plugin load: an empty list, a non-integer, a value below 2, or a duplicate throws, never a silent fall-back to defaults; `argumentsPreviewChars` equally rejects anything but an integer >= 1. The list is normalized to ascending order; the FIRST threshold delivers a short generic nudge, every later threshold delivers the detailed form naming the tool, the run length, and the canonical arguments — head-truncated at `argumentsPreviewChars` with an omitted-count marker, so a looping `write`/`edit` payload cannot ride into the next request unbounded (the chain key always compares the FULL canonical string; the cap bounds the reminder, never the detection).

`include`/`exclude` entries support `*` wildcards and are predicates over whatever tools exist at call time, not references to registry entries — a pattern matching no currently registered tool is NOT an error (`exclude: [mcp_*]` stays valid in a deployment that loads no MCP tools), unlike `toolOrder`'s referent check.

`explorationThresholds` uses the same validation as `thresholds`. Calls matching `explorationTools` increment a per-agent exploration count. Calls matching `progressTools` reset it because they leave an observable work product; `str_replace_editor` with `command: view` remains exploration rather than progress. User input also resets the count. Tool names are wildcard predicates, so deployments can tune both sets without changing code.

## Chain semantics

The chain key is `(tool name, canonical arguments)` — canonicalization is a deep key-sort plus `JSON.stringify`, so argument objects differing only in property order count as identical. A call identical to the previous tracked call increments the agent's consecutive counter; a different tracked call resets it to 1.

- **Untracked calls are transparent to the chain.** A call excluded by `include`/`exclude` neither increments nor resets the counter, so `grep X → todo_write → grep X` still counts as two consecutive `grep X` when `todo_write` is excluded. This is what makes exclusion useful: bookkeeping tools interleaved into a loop must not launder it.
- **Denied calls count.** Detection sits on `tools/post-execute`, which also runs for calls a `tools/pre-execute` listener denied — a model hammering a denied call is exactly the loop worth breaking.
- **Calls without an agent are ignored.** A direct `ctx.tools.execute()` caller has no model to remind and no live agent object to key on.
- **Per-agent keying.** The tool registry is context-level and subagents interleave through the same waterfall, so a `WeakMap<Agent, Chain>` keys each chain by the live agent object; one agent's repetition never trips another's reminder. A user prompt (`agent/pre-step`) resets the submitting agent's chain, and object lifetime bounds the weak entry without a disposal listener.
- **In-memory only.** A session resumed from persistence starts with a fresh chain — the guard is a heuristic nudge, not a logged invariant, later reminders are the accepted cost.

## Reminder delivery

Reminders ride the post-execute decision's `additionalContexts` (source `{kind: 'plugin', plugin: 'repeat-tool-reminder'}`), never a `content` replacement: the `tool/result` event stays the tool's own output for audit. The loop buffers the context and appends it as an injected `user/message` after the step's tool results, which the session renders as a plain synthetic user message — so the reminder is model-visible, source-attributed, and reconstructable from the session log with no new session event. The guard always delegates via `next()` and prepends its reminder to the downstream decision's context array (both variants — a blocked call still gets the nudge); every entry retains its own source and metadata.

## Model Experience

### First-threshold context message

#### What the model sees

At the first configured consecutive-repeat threshold, that agent receives the reminder below. No tool schema or normal-call text is added.

##### First-threshold reminder

```markdown
You are repeating the exact same tool call with identical arguments. Carefully analyze the previous result before calling again: if the task is not complete, try a different approach or different arguments instead of repeating the call.
```

#### Token effect

Zero tokens before the threshold. The reminder is retained history for that agent.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

### Later-threshold context message

#### What the model sees

A later threshold receives the detailed reminder template below. A capped argument preview ends exactly `… (+<omitted> more chars)`.

##### Later-threshold reminder

```markdown
Repeated tool call detected:
- tool: <toolName>
- consecutive_calls: <count>
- arguments: <canonicalArguments>
The repeated calls are not making progress. Do not call this tool with these exact arguments again. Inspect the latest result and choose a different action, different arguments, or finish the task if enough evidence has been gathered.
```

#### Token effect

Each reminder is retained history; `argumentsPreviewChars` bounds its data-dependent argument text, while agents keep independent counters.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Exact-match detection only** — canonicalization is a deep key-sort, so near-identical variants (a tweaked path, extra whitespace inside a value) evade the chain; fuzzy matching is rejected pending evidence of need.
- **Compaction does not reset chains** — a chain spanning a compaction checkpoint keeps counting.
- **Advisory only** — escalating to `block` at a high threshold is not implemented, though `PostToolDecision` already supports blocking.
- **No subagent chain-sharing** — chains stay isolated per agent; a parent and its subagent repeating the same call never combine.
- **Legitimate idempotent polling still draws nudges** past the thresholds — the pressure valves are `thresholds`/`exclude` config.
- **Past the highest threshold a chain goes silent** — reminders fire only at exact configured counts, never beyond them.
- **Progress is tool-observed, not outcome-scored** — a configured mutation or delegation call resets exploration even if its result later proves poor. Tests and final quality gates still decide whether the work is correct.
